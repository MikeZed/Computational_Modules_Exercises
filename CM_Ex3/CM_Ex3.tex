      \item A function $f : \AB^* \rightarrow \AB^*$ is computable if there exists a TM that for every
            $x \in \AB^*$ halts with $f(x)$ on its tape, when given $x$ as input.
            Let $f : \AB^* \rightarrow \AB^*$ be a function, then let us define $\lang_f = {(x, f(x)) : x \in \AB^*}$
