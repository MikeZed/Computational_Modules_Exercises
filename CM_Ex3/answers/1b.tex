Let $M = (Q, \AB, \Gamma, \de, q_0, q_a, q_r)$ be a single-tape TM. \\
Formally describe a 2-tape TM with 3 states that accepts $L(M)$.

For convenience, we will denote accessing the various fields of the 3-tuple
of the output of $\de$ by: \\
$\de(q', \ch')[q]$ - the next state according to $\de(q', \ch')$ \\
$\de(q', \ch')[\ch]$ - the symbol to be written to the tape according to $\de(q', \ch')$ \\
$\de(q', \ch')[D]$ - the direction of the head movement according to $\de(q', \ch')$ \\

We will denote the required TM by $M'$. \\
The formal description of $M'$ will be: \\
$ M' = (Q', \AB, \Gamma', \de', q_0', q_a', q_r') $ such that: \\
$ Q'      = \{q_0', q_a', q_r'\} $ \\
$ \AB'    = \AB $ \\
$ \Gamma' = \Gamma \cup Q \cup \{\sqcup\} $ (we assume w.l.o.g. that $\Gamma \cap Q = \emptyset$) \\
\[
    \de'(q_0', (\ch, q_M)) = \left.
    \begin{cases}
        (q_0', (\ch, q_0), (L, L)) ,                                            & (\ch, q_M) \in \Gamma \times \{\sqcup\}                \\
        (q_0', (\de(q_M, \ch)[\ch], \de(q_M, \ch)[q]), (\de(q_M, \ch)[D], L)) , & (\ch, q_M) \in \Gamma \times Q \backslash \{q_a, q_r\} \\
        (q_a', (\ch, q_M), (R, L)),                                             & q_M = q_a                                              \\
        (q_r', (\ch, q_M), (R, L)),                                             & q_M = q_r                                              \\
        (q_r', (\ch, q_M), (R, L)),                                             & else                                                   \\
    \end{cases}
    \right\} , \ch, q_M \in \Gamma' \\

Short explanation: \\
First tape will hold the input and will simulate the tape of $M$.
The head above the first tape moves like the head of TM $M$,
except in the first step - where the second tape is initialized with
the initial state of $M$, $q_0$.

Second tape is used to track the current state of $M$.
The head above the second tape always 'moves left' in order to
stay in the beginning of the tape, above the current state of $M$.

The TM follows the transition between states of $M$ and accepts
when we reach the accepting state of $M$, if we reach the rejecting state of $M$ - we reject.
