$\Rcl$ is closed under Kleene star. \\

The claim is true. \\

Proof: \\
Let there be $\lang \in \Rcl$, we will show that $\lang^* \in \Rcl$. \\
$\lang \in \Rcl$ so there is a TM $M$ that decides $\lang$. \\
We shall build a non-deterministic TM $N$ that decides $\lang^*$:

$N \text{ on input } x$: \\
1. choose an arbitrary split of $x$ to parts. \\
2. run $M$ on each of the parts. \\
3. accept iff $M$ accepts all parts. \\

So we get: \\
if $x \in \lang^*$ then
$\exists x_1,...,x_n \in \lang: x=x_1...x_n \rightarrow $ in one of the computational
paths for input $x$, $N$ will choose the $x=x_1...x_n$ split for $x$ and $M$ would accepts all of its parts
(since $\forall 1 \leq i \leq n: x_i \in \lang$) $\rightarrow N$ accepts. \\

if $x \notin \lang^*$  then
$\nexists x_1,...,x_n \in \lang: x=x_1...x_n \rightarrow $ there is no computational
path for input $x$, in which $N$ will choose a split such that $M$ would accepts all of its parts.
But, because $M$ decides $\lang$ we will get that $M$ will reject at least one of the parts in
each of the arbitrary splits and accept the others and wouldn't be stuck in a loop $\rightarrow N$ rejects. \\

Indeed we get that $N$ decides $\lang^*$. \\
So we get that  $\Rcl$ is closed under Kleene star, as required. \\
