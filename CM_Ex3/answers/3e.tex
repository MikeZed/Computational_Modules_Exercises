Let us define $LHS(\lang) = \{x : \exists y \text{ such that } xy \in \lang\ \text{ and } |x| = |y|\}$

\begin{enumerate}[i.]
      \item $\REcl$ is closed under LHS.

            The claim is true. \\

            Proof: \\
            Let there be $\lang \in \REcl$, we will show that $LHS(\lang) \in \REcl$. \\
            $\lang \in \REcl$ so there is TM $M$ that accepts $\lang$. \\
            We shall build a non-deterministic TM $N$ that accepts $LHS(\lang)$:

            $N \text{ on input } x$: \\
            1. Order $\AB^{|x|}$ in a lexicographic order. \\
            2. For each word $y$ in that order, run $M$ on $w=xy$ in parallel. \\
            3. Accept iff $M$ accepts for some word $w=xy$. \\

            Note - instead of using a non-deterministic TM, we can run $M$ on each of \\
            the words in 'parallel' by running each time on an increasing number of \\
            words for an increasing number of steps, just like we did in the lecture and recitation. \\

            So we get: \\
            If $x \in LHS(\lang)$ then: \\
            $\exists y \in \AB^{|x|}: w=xy \in \lang \rightarrow $ in one of the computational
            paths for input $x$, $N$ will choose $y$ for input $x$ and $M$ would accept $w=xy$. \\
            $\rightarrow N$ accepts. \\

            If $x \notin LHS(\lang)$ then: \\
            $\nexists y \in \AB^{|x|}: w=xy \in \lang \rightarrow $ there is no computational
            path for input $x$, in which $N$ will choose $y$ such that $w=xy \in \lang$,
            so $M$ would reject or be stuck in a loop for every $w=xy$. \\
            $\rightarrow N$ rejects or stuck in a loop. \\

            Indeed we get that $N$ accepts $LHS(\lang)$. \\
            So we get that $\REcl$ is closed under LHS, as required. \\

      \item $\Rcl$ is closed under LHS.

            The claim is true. \\

            Proof: \\
            Let there be $\lang \in \Rcl$, we will show that $LHS(\lang) \in \Rcl$. \\
            $\lang \in \Rcl$ so there is TM $M$ that decides $\lang$. \\
            We shall build a deterministic TM $M'$ that decides $LHS(\lang)$:

            $M' \text{ on input } x$: \\
            1. Order $\AB^{|x|}$ in a lexicographic order. \\
            2. For each word $y$ in that order, run $M$ on $w=xy$. \\
            3. Accept iff $M$ accepts for some word $w=xy$. \\

            So we get: \\
            If $x \in LHS(\lang)$ then: \\
            $\exists y \in \AB^{|x|}: w=xy \in \lang \rightarrow $ at some point, $M$ would run on $w=xy$ and accept it. \\
            $\rightarrow M'$ accepts. \\ \\

            If $x \notin LHS(\lang)$ then: \\
            $\nexists y \in \AB^{|x|}: w=xy \in \lang \rightarrow $ $M$ would reject $w=xy$ for every $y \in \AB^{|x|}$. \\
            $\rightarrow M'$ rejects. \\

            Notice that $M$ doesn't get stuck in a loop for any $w=xy$ because it decides $\lang$.
            Also there is a finite amount of extensions $y$ for $x$ ($=|\AB|^{|x|}$).
            Therefore $M'$ doesn't get stuck in a loop. \\

            Indeed we get that $M'$ accepts $LHS(\lang)$. \\
            So we get that $\Rcl$ is closed under LHS, as required. \\
