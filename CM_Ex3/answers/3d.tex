Let us define $Prefix(\lang) = \{x : \exists y \text{ such that } xy \in \lang\}$

\begin{enumerate}[i.]
    \item $\REcl$ is closed under Prefix.

          The claim is true. \\

          Proof: \\
          Let there be $\lang \in \REcl$, we will show that $Prefix(\lang) \in \REcl$. \\
          $\lang \in \REcl$ so there is TM $M$ that accepts $\lang$. \\
          We shall build a non-deterministic TM $N$ that accepts $Prefix(\lang)$:

          $N \text{ on input } x$: \\
          1. order $\AB^*$ in a lexicographic order. \\
          2. for each word $y$ in that order, run $M$ on $w=xy$ in parallel. \\
          3. accept iff $M$ accepts for some word $w=xy$. \\

          Note - instead of using a non-deterministic TM, we can run $M$ on each of \\
          the words in 'parallel' by running each time on an increasing number of \\
          words for an increasing number of steps, just like we did in the lecture and recitation. \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\


          \TODO
          So we get: \\
          if $x \in Prefix(\lang)$ then
          $\exists y \in \AB^*: w=xy \in \lang \rightarrow $ in one of the computational
          paths for input $x$, $N$ will choose $y$ for $x$ and $M$ would accept $w=xy \in \lang$
          $\rightarrow N$ accepts. \\

          if $x \notin \lang^*$  then
          $\nexists x_1,...,x_n \in \lang: x=x_1...x_n \rightarrow $ there is no computational
          path for input $x$, in which $N$ will choose a split such that $M$ would accepts all of its parts.
          But, because $M$ decides $\lang$ we will get that $M$ will reject at least one of the parts in
          each of the arbitrary splits and accept the others and wouldn't be stuck in a loop $\rightarrow N$ rejects. \\

          Indeed we get that $N$ decides $\lang^*$. \\
          So we get that  $\Rcl$ is closed under Kleene star, as required. \\



    \item $\Rcl$ is closed under Prefix.
