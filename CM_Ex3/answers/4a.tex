Prove that if $L_f \in \REcl$ then $f$ is computable.

Proof: \\
$L_f \in \REcl$ so there is TM $E$ that enumerates the words of $L_f$ on its output tape. \\
We shall construct TM $M$ that computes $f$:

$M \text{ on input } x$: \\
1. Run the enumerator $E$. \\
2. Scan the output of the enumerator $E$ and searches for $x$ in the first part of each pair. \\
3. When finds the proper pair, takes the second part of the pair, which is $f(x)$. \\
4. Write $f(x)$ on the tape. \\
5. Accept. \\

Indeed, $\forall x \in \AB^*$ we get that for $M(x)$: \\
- At some point the enumerator $E$ will write the pair $(x, f(x))$ on its
output tape (since $(x, f(x)) \in \lang_f$). \\
- While scanning the enumerator's output tape, $M$ will find a pair with $x$ as its first element. \\
- $M$ will extract the second element from the pair - $f(x)$ and write it on its tape,
thus computing $f(x)$. \\

In conclusion, we constructed a TM that computes $f$, thus $f$ is computable. As required. \\
