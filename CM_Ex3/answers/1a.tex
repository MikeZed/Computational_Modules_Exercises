Let $A = (Q, \AB, \de, q_0, F)$ be a DFA. \\
Formally describe a 2-tape TM with 3 states that accepts $L(A)$. \\

We will denote the required TM by $M'$. \\
The formal description of $M'$ will be: \\
$ M' = (Q', \AB, \Gamma', \de', q_0', q_a', q_r') $ such that: \\
$ Q'      = \{q_0', q_a', q_r'\} $ \\
$ \AB'    = \AB $ \\
$ \Gamma' = \AB \cup Q \cup \{\sqcup\} $ (we assume w.l.o.g. that $\AB \cap Q = \emptyset$) \\
\[
    \de'(q_0', (\ch, q_A)) = \left.
    \begin{cases}
        (q_0', (\ch, q_0), (L, L)) ,           & (\ch, q_A) \in (\AB' \cup \{\sqcup\}) \times \{\sqcup\} \\
        (q_0', (\ch, \de(q_A, \ch)), (R, L)) , & (\ch, q_A) \in \AB' \times Q                            \\
        (q_a', (\ch, q_A), (R, L)),            & (\ch, q_A) \in \{\sqcup\} \times F                      \\
        (q_r', (\ch, q_A), (R, L)),            & else                                                    \\
    \end{cases}
    \right\} , \ch, q_A \in \Gamma' \\
\]

Short explanation: \\
First tape will hold the input. In order to read the input
(like in a DFA) the head above the first tape always moves right,
except in the first step - where the second tape is initialized with
the initial state of $A$, $q_0$.

Second tape is used to track the current state of $A$.
The head above the second tape always 'moves left' in order to
stay in the beginning of the tape, above the current state of $A$.

The TM follows the transition between states of $A$ and accepts
when we reach the end of the input and are at an accepting state of $A$,
if we reach the end of the input and are not at an accepting state - we reject.
