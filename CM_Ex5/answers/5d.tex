Input: a directed graph $G$.
Question: does there exist a hamiltonian cycle in $G$?

We need to show that: \\
$HAMCYCLE = \{\langle G \rangle: G \text{ is a directed graph with a hamiltonian cycle }\} \in \NPCcl$ \\

Proof: \\
We will show that: \\
1. $HAMCYCLE \in NP$ \\
2. $\forall \lang' \in \NPcl: \lang' \leq_p HAMCYCLE$ by showing that $HAMPATH \leq_p HAMCYCLE$ (we can do this since $HAMPATH \in NPC$) \\

First we show that $HAMCYCLE \in NP$, by building a polynomial verifier $V$ for it. \\
$V$ for input $(\langle G \rangle, w)$:
\begin{enumerate}[1., itemsep=5pt]
    \item Verify that $\langle G \rangle$ is a valid encoding of a directed graph, if it's not - reject.
    \item Check whether $w$ is an encoding of a hamiltonian cycle in $G$, if it is - accept, otherwise - reject.
\end{enumerate}

So we get: \\
If $\langle G \rangle \in HAMCYCLE$ \\
$\Rightarrow \langle G \rangle$ is a valid encoding of a directed graph with a hamiltonian cycle \\
$\Rightarrow $ For $w$ that is the encoding of a hamiltonian cycle in graph $G$, $V$ will accept $(\langle G \rangle, w)$
$\Rightarrow $ There exists $w \in \AB^*$ such that $V$ accepts $(\langle G \rangle, w)$. \\

If $\langle G \rangle \notin HAMCYCLE$ \\
$\Rightarrow \langle G \rangle$ is not a valid encoding of a directed graph or it doesn't have a hamiltonian cycle \\
If $\langle G \rangle$ is not a valid encoding a directed graph $\Rightarrow V$ rejects. \\
If it is a valid encoding of a directed graph but it doesn't have a hamiltonian cycle \\
$\Rightarrow V$ rejects $(\langle G \rangle, w)$ for every $w \in \AB^*$. \\

Also $V$'s runtime on input $(\langle G \rangle, w)$
(where $|\langle G \rangle|=n$) is: \\
- For step (1): $O(n))$  \\
- For step (2): $O(n))$  \\
Thus, the total runtime of $V$ on input  $(\langle G \rangle, w)$ is polynomial \\
in $|\langle G \rangle|=n$, so \underline{$HAMCYCLE \in \NPcl$}. \\

\pagebreak

Now, we will show that there is a polynomial reduction from $HAMPATH$ to $HAMCYCLE$: \\
We define the following reduction $f: \AB^* \rightarrow \AB^*$:

$
    f(\langle G, s, t \rangle) =
    \begin{cases}
        \langle G'' \rangle, & \langle G, s, t \rangle \text{ is not a valid encoding } \\
        \langle G' \rangle,  & else                                                     \\
    \end{cases}
$

Where graph $G'$ is the same directed graph $G$ with the additional vertex $u$ and 2 additional edges: $(t, u)$ and $(u, s)$. \\
$\langle G'' \rangle$ is an invalid encoding of a directed graph ($\rightarrow \langle G'' \rangle \notin HAMCYCLE$).

Notice that $f$ is computable in polynomial time in $|\langle G, s, t \rangle|$, since we just check
if the input's encoding is valid and if it is - we just add an edge in graph $G$.

Also $\forall x = \langle  G, s, t \rangle \in \AB^*$:

If $x = \langle  G, s, t \rangle \in HAMPATH$ \\
$\Rightarrow G$ is a directed graph with hamiltonian path from $s$ to $t$ \\
$\Rightarrow f(\langle  G, s, t \rangle) = \langle G' \rangle$, which is the same directed
graph $G$ with the additional vertex $u$ and 2 additional edges: $(t, u)$ and $(u, s)$,
meaning that if we take the hamiltonian path from $s$ to $t$ and add to it the additional edges $(t, u)$ and $(u, s)$,
then we will get a hamiltonian cycle in $G'$. \\
$\Rightarrow f(\langle  G, s, t \rangle) = \langle G' \rangle \in HAMCYCLE$ \\

If $x = \langle  G, s, t \rangle \notin HAMPATH$ \\
$\Rightarrow \langle  G, s, t \rangle$ is not valid encoding or $G$ is a directed graph with no hamiltonian path from $s$ to $t$. \\
If $\langle  G, s, t \rangle$ is not valid encoding \\
$\Rightarrow f(\langle  G, s, t \rangle) = \langle G'' \rangle \notin HAMCYCLE$ \\
If $G$ is a directed graph with no hamiltonian path from $s$ to $t$ \\
$\Rightarrow $ If we assume that $f(\langle  G, s, t \rangle) = \langle G' \rangle \in HAMCYCLE$ \\
it means that there is a hamiltonian cycle in $G'$ of the following form:\\
$a \rightarrow b \rightarrow ... \rightarrow t \rightarrow u \rightarrow s \rightarrow w \rightarrow ... \rightarrow a$ \\
so if we remove the additional vertex $u$ from graph $G'$ and return to the original graph $G$,
then we have a hamiltonian cycle from $s$ to $t$: \\
$s \rightarrow w \rightarrow ... \rightarrow a \rightarrow b \rightarrow ... \rightarrow t$\\
in contradiction with $G$ being a directed graph with no hamiltonian path from $s$ to $t$.

$\Rightarrow f(\langle  G, s, t \rangle) \notin HAMCYCLE$ \\

So we get \underline{$HAMPATH \leq_p HAMCYCLE$}. \\
In conclusion, $HAMCYCLE \in \NPCcl$. As required.
