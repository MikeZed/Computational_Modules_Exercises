Prove that if $\lang \in \NPcl$, then $\lang$ has a polynomial verifier that only accepts
certificates of length exactly $p(|x|)$ for some polynomial $p$. \\

Proof: \\
$\lang \in \NPcl$, therefore there exists a polynomial verifier $V$ for $\lang$, that runs in a polynomial-time $p$. \\
We will define verifier $V'$ for $\lang$: \\
First we set $V'$'s $\AB_{V'}$ to be $\AB_{V'}=\AB_{V} \cup \{\#\}$ assuming w.l.o.g.
$\AB_{V} \cap \{\#\} = \emptyset$ (to pad the cerificate when it is too short). \\

$V'$ on input $(x, w)$:
\begin{enumerate}[1., itemsep=5pt]

    \item Verify that $|w|=p(|x|)$, if it is not - reject.
    \item If $w$ is padded with $'\#'$s at its end, remove them from $w$.
    \item Run $V(x, w)$.
    \item Accept iff $V(x, w)$ accepts.

\end{enumerate}


Notice the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(i), itemsep=5pt]
    \item $V$ is a polynomial verifier with runtime that is at most $p(|x|)$, hence it would not look beyond the first $p(|x|)$ symbols of $w$,
          meaning that if $w$ is a cerificate, then $w'$, which we define as the first $p(|x|)$ symbols of $w$, is also a certificate for $x$.

    \item If the length of the certificate $w$ is shorter than $p(|x|)$, then we can pad $w$ until its length reaches exactly $p(|x|)$.

\end{enumerate}

Indeed: \\
If $x \in \lang$ \\
$\Rightarrow $ There exists $w \in \AB^*$ such that $V$ accepts $(x, w)$. \\
There are 3 options: $|w| = p(|x|)$ or $|w| > p(|x|)$ or $|w| < p(|x|)$ \\
If $|w| = p(|x|) \\ \Rightarrow V'$ accepts $(x, w)$ \\
If $|w| > p(|x|) \\ \Rightarrow $ From point (i) above, $V'$ accepts $(x, w')$, where $w'$ is the first $p(|x|)$ symbols of $w$ \\
If $|w| < p(|x|) \\ \Rightarrow $ From point (ii) above, $V'$ accepts $(x, w')$, where $w'$ is $w$ padded by $(p(|x|) - |w|)$ $'\#'$s (the padding is removed inside $V'$) \\
$\Longrightarrow $ There exists $w' \in \AB^*$ such that $V'$ accepts $(x, w')$. \\

If $x \notin \lang$ \\
$\Rightarrow V$ rejects $(x, w)$ for every $w \in \AB^*$. \\
$\Rightarrow V'$ rejects $(x, w)$ for every $w \in \AB^*$.

So $V'$ is a verifier for $\lang$, and from step (1) it only accepts certificates of length exactly $p(|x|)$.

\pagebreak

Also $V'$'s runtime on input $(x, w)$ (where $|x|=n$) is: \\
- For step (1): $O(p(n))$ \\
- For step (2): $O(p(n))$ \\
- For step (3): $O(p(n))$ \\
- For step (3): $O(1)$ \\

Thus, the total runtime of $V'$ on input  $(x, w)$ is polynomial in $|x|=n$. \\

In conclusion, $V'$ is polynomial verifier for $\lang$, that only accepts certificates of length exactly $p(|x|)$.
As required.
