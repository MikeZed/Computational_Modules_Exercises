Prove that if $\Pcl = \NPcl$, then there exists a polynomial-time TM that given a CNF formula \\
$\phi$ outputs a satisfying assignment for $\phi$ or indicates one does not exists.

Proof:
First notice that $CNFSAT = \{\phi: \phi is a satisfiable CNF formula\} \in \NPcl$
since we can build a polynomial verifier $V$ for it:

$V$ for input $(\langle \phi \rangle, w)$:
\begin{enumerate}[1., itemsep=5pt]
    \item Verify that $(\langle \phi \rangle$ is an encoding of a valid CNF formula, if it's not - reject.

    \item Verify that and that $w$ is a possible assignment to the variables in $\phi$, if it's not - reject.

    \item Assign values to the variables in $\phi$ according to $w$, if the formula is satisfied - accept, otherwise reject.

\end{enumerate}

Indeed: \\
If $\langle \phi \rangle \in CNFSAT$ \\
$\Rightarrow \langle \phi \rangle$ is a valid encoding of a CNF formula
and there exists assignment to its variables $w \in \AB^*$ such that $\phi$ is satisfied. \\
$\Rightarrow $ There exists $w \in \AB^*$ such that $V$ accepts $(\langle \phi \rangle, w)$. \\

If $\langle \phi \rangle \notin CNFSAT$ \\
$\Rightarrow \langle \phi \rangle$ is not a valid encoding of a CNF formula
or there doesn't exist assignment to its variables $w \in \AB^*$ such that $\phi$ is satisfied. \\
If $\langle \phi \rangle$ is not a valid encoding of a CNF formula $\Rightarrow V$ rejects. \\
If there doesn't exist assignment to $\phi$'s variables $w \in \AB^*$ such that $\phi$ is satisfied. \\
$\Rightarrow V$ does rejects $(\langle \phi \rangle, w)$ for every $c \in \AB^*$.

V is polynomial time

V is in NP so its in P

so there exists TM M that decides it and runs in polynomial time.

assign variable to phi one by one and check if satisfiable
