$\Pcl$ is closed under Kleene Star. \\

Proof: \\

Let there be $\lang \in \Pcl$, we will show that $\lang^* \in \Pcl$. \\
$\lang \in \Pcl$ so there is a deterministic TM $M$ that decides $\lang$ in polynomial time $p$. \\
We shall build a deterministic TM $M'$ that decides $\lang^*$ in a polynomial time of its input's length:

$M'$ on input $x$:

    \begin{enumerate}[1., itemsep=5pt]

        \item Choose an arbitrary split of $x$ to parts.

        \item Run $M$ on each of the parts (one after the other).

        \item Accept iff $M$ accepts all parts.

    \end{enumerate}

    So we get: \\
    If $x \in \lang^*$ then: \\
    $\exists x_1,...,x_n \in \lang: x=x_1...x_n \Rightarrow $ in one of the computational
    paths for input $x$, $M'$ will choose the $x=x_1...x_M$ split for $x$ and $M$ would accepts all of its parts
    (since $\forall 1 \leq i \leq n: x_i \in \lang$). \\
    $\Rightarrow M'$ accepts. \\

    If $x \notin \lang^*$ then: \\
    $\nexists x_1,...,x_n \in \lang: x=x_1...x_n \Rightarrow $ there is no computational
    path for input $x$, in which $M'$ will choose a split such that $M$ would accepts all of its parts.
    Because $M$ decides $\lang$, we will get that $M$ will reject at least one of the parts in
    each of the arbitrary splits and accept the others and wouldn't be stuck in a loop. \\
    $\Rightarrow M'$ rejects. \\

    Indeed, we get that $M'$ decides $\lang^*$. \\
    And its runtime on input $x$ is: \\
    - For step (1): $O(|x|)$ \\
    - For step (2): $p(|x|) \cdot$(number of parts of $x$) = $p(|x|) \cdot O(|x|)$ \\
    - For step (3): $O(|x|)$
}
}

Thus, the total runtime of $M'$ on input $x$ is polynomial in $|x|$, so $\lang^* \in \NPcl$. \\
So we get that $\Pcl$ is closed under Kleene Star, as required. \\
