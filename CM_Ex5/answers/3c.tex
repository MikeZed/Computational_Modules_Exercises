If $\lang_1, \lang_2 \in \NPCcl$, then there exists a polynomial shrinking
reduction from $\lang_1$ to $\lang_2$.

The claim is false.  \\

Proof:  \\
Notice that in the previous section we saw that for $\lang_1 = \lang_2 = SAT \in NPC \subseteq \NPcl$
there is no polynomial shrinking reduction from $\lang_1$ to $\lang_2$. Hence the same proof applies here.
