\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Let \(\lang\)  be a regular language. For each of the following languages,
            we shall build an NFA that accepts it and then prove its correctness.
            \(\lang\) is regular, therefore there exists a DFA \(A=(Q, \AB, \delta, q_0, F)\)
            that accepts it, we shall use this DFA in all of the following subsections.

            \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \input{answers/1a.tex}
                  \item \input{answers/1b.tex}
                  \item \input{answers/1c.tex}
            \end{enumerate}

            \pagebreak

      \item We shall present a regular expression for the following languages and give a short
            explanation for their correctness:

            \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \input{answers/2a.tex}
                  \item \input{answers/2b.tex}
                  \item \input{answers/2c.tex}
            \end{enumerate}

            \pagebreak

      \item We shall prove that the following languages are not regular:
            \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \input{answers/3a.tex}
                  \item \input{answers/3b.tex}
                  \item \input{answers/3c.tex}
            \end{enumerate}

            \pagebreak

      \item \input{answers/4.tex}

      \item \input{answers/5.tex}


\end{enumerate}

\bd{Bonus.} \\
We will define a state per equivalence class of $\lang$
transition function according to the equivalence class
accepting state if
