Define operation $\diamond$ :
\[
    A \diamond B = \{xy : x \in A \wedge y \in B \wedge |x| = |y|\}
\]
Prove/Disprove: $A$ and $B$ are regular imply $A \diamond B$ is regular. \\

We shall disprove the above. \\
We will present an example with languages over the binary alphabet $\AB = \{0, 1\}$ \\
Note that for $A=\{0\}^*$ and $B=\{1\}^*$ we get: \\
$
    \begin{aligned}
        A \diamond B & = \{xy : x \in A \wedge y \in B \wedge |x| = |y|\}             \\
                     & = \{xy : x \in \{0\}^* \wedge y \in \{1\}^* \wedge |x| = |y|\} \\
                     & = \{0^n 1^n : n \geq 0\}
    \end{aligned}
$ \\
Note that $A$ and $B$ can be presented as regular expressions: $A=L(0^*), B=L(1^*)$,
so they are regular languages. But we saw in class that $A \diamond B =\{0^n 1^n : n \geq 0\}$
is not a regular language. \\
Therefore the operation $\diamond$ between regular language does not necessarily
returns a regular language and the claim is false. \\
