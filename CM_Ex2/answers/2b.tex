$\lang = \{ w \in \AB^* : |w| \text{ mod 4 } = 2\}$

Note that $\lang$ contains all the possible words over $\AB$
that are of length $|w|=n=4k+2, k \in \nat \cup \{0\}$. \\
Therefore a regular expression for the language would be a string of $\{0,1\}$ of length 2
followed by any number of times the string $\{0,1\}$ of length 4:

$
    \begin{aligned}
        R_\lang & =(0 \cup 1)(0 \cup 1)((0 \cup 1)(0 \cup 1)(0 \cup 1)(0 \cup 1))^* \\
                & =(0 \cup 1)^2((0 \cup 1)^4)^*
    \end{aligned}
$ \\
