$\lang = \{ w \in \AB^* : \#_0(w) \leq 3\}$

Note that $\lang$ contains all the possible words over $\AB$ that have at most three 0's.
Therefore a regular expression for the language would be at most three 0's (which is equivalent to
three times the regular expression $(\empw \cup 0)$) and an arbitrary number of 1's that can be inbetween,
before and after these 0's: \\
$R_\lang =1^*(\empw \cup 0)1^*(\empw \cup 0)1^*(\empw \cup 0)1^*$ \\
