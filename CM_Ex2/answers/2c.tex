The complement of $\lang((0 \cup 10 \cup 110)^*(\empw \cup 1 \cup 11))$

Note that the first part ($(0 \cup 10 \cup 110)^*$) gives us an arbitrary number of 0's
and sequences that contain 1 or 11 and followed by an arbitrary number of 0's (\bd{at least one 0}).
And the second part ($\empw \cup 1 \cup 11$) gives us the empty word or 1 or 11.

Therefore the words in the language have sequences of at most two 1's
and the complement of language will be words that are arbitrary strings that contain at least three 1's:

$R_\lang = (0 \cup 1)^*111(0 \cup 1)^*$ \\
