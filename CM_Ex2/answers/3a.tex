$\lang=\{w : \#_0(w) \geq \#_1(w)\}\}$ (using closure properties) \\
We will prove by contradiction - we will assume that is $\lang$ is regular.

Note that: $\lang \cap \lang_1 = \lang_2$ \\
for $\lang_1 = \lang(0^*1^*) $ and $\lang_2 = \{w = 0^i1^j : i \geq j\}\}$ \\
$\lang_1$ is regular because it can be presented as a regular expression. \\
$\lang_2$ is not regular as we will show below by using the Myhill-Nerode Theorem: \\

Note that for $i > j$ we get $x = 0^i \nceq{\lang_2} 0^j = y$,
since for $z=1^i \in \AB^*$ we get:

$xz = 0^i 1^i \in \lang_2$, \\
but $yz = 0^j 1^i \notin \lang_2$

Therefore, each $ 0^i $ belongs to a different equivalence class for every $i \geq 0$, \\
meaning $|\AB^* / \ceq{\lang_2}| \geq |\{0^i: i \geq 0\}| = \infty$ \\
We got that $\lang_2$ has an infinite number of equivalence classes, hence from
Myhill-Nerode Theorem we get that $\lang_2$ is not regular. \\

But, because $\lang$ and $\lang_1$ are regular, from closure properties
for intersection of regular languages we get that $\lang_2$ is regular too, but its not.
Hence we got a contradiction and $\lang$ not is regular. \\
