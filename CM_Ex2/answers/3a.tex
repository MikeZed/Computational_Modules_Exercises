$\lang=\{w : \#_0(w) \geq \#_1(w)\}\}$ (using closure properties) \\
We will prove by contradiction - we will assume that is $\lang$ is regular.

{
    Note that: $\lang \cap \lang_1 = \lang_2$ \\
    for $\lang_1 = $ \\
    and $\lang_2 = $ \\
    $\lang_1$ is regular \\
    $\lang_2$ is not regular \\
    But, because $\lang$ and $\lang_1$ are regular, from closure properties
    for intersection of languages we get that $\lang_2$ is regular too, but its not.
    Hence we got a contradiction and $\lang$ not is regular.
