A TM is {\it expected poly-time } if there exists $p \in poly$ such that for every x the
expected running time of $M(x)$ is at most $p(|x|)$.
Let us define: \\
$ZPP = \{\lang \subseteq \AB^*: \text{ there exists an expected poly-time TM that decided } \lang\}$ \\
Prove that $ZPP = RP \cap coRP$.

Proof: \\
We need to show that: \\
1. $ZPP \subseteq RP \cap coRP$
2. $ZPP \supseteq RP \cap coRP$

\underline{$ZPP \subseteq RP \cap coRP$:} \\
Let $\lang \in ZPP$, so there exists



\underline{$ZPP \supseteq RP \cap coRP$:} \\
Let $\lang \in RP \cap coRP$, so $\lang \in RP \wedge \lang \in coRP$. Therefore there exists



so we get that $ZPP = RP \cap coRP$. As required.
