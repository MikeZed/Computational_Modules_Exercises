The distance between vertices $u$, $v$ in a graph $G$ is the number of edges in a
shortest path connecting them. The diameter of a graph $G$ is the greatest
distance between any pair of vertices in $G$. \\
Prove that: \\
$\lang = \{\langle G, D \rangle | G \text{ is a directed graphwith diameter at most } D \}
    \in DSPACE(\text{log }n \cdot \text{log }D)$.
