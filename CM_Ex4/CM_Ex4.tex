      \item Given $\bigC \subseteq \REcl$, recall that $\lang_\bigC = \{\langle M \rangle : \lang(M) \in \bigC\}$.
            Let $\bigC \subseteq \REcl$ such that $\bigC \neq \emptyset$ and $\bigC \neq \REcl$.

      \item For each of the following languages, find the minimal (relative to inclusion)
            class it belongs to between $\Rcl/\REcl/co\REcl/\overline{\REcl \cup co\REcl}$:
            \begin{enumerate}

            \end{enumerate}

            \pagebreak

      \item Recall that a verifier $V$ for a language $\lang \subseteq \AB^*$ is a deterministic TM such
            that for every $x \in \AB^*$: \\
            - If $x \in \lang$ then there exists $c \in \AB^*$ such that $V$ accepts $(x, c)$. \\
            - If $x \notin \lang$ then $V$ rejects $(x, c)$ for every $c \in \AB^*$. \\
            Prove that the following definitions are equivalent to the aforementioned one
            (i.e a language has a verifier iff it has a modified verifier):
