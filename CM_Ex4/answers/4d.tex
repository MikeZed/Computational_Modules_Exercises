$\lang = \{\langle M \rangle : \nexists M' \text{ a 2-tape TM } (\text{with } q'_0 \neq q'_a \neq q'_r) \text{ such that } \\
    \lang(M')=\lang(M) \text{ and } M' \text{ has less states than } M\}$ \\

We will show that $\lang \in \Rcl$. \\

From the previous homework exercise (HW03) question 1b, for any 1-tape TM there is 2-tape TM with 3 states that simulates it. \\
Therefore all the TM in $\lang$ have exactly 2 states (there can't be less than 2 states since for every TM $q_a \neq q_r$)
meaning that for every TM in $\lang$ - $q_0 = q_a$ or $q_0 = q_r$ (so the TM accepts or rejects every word
$\Rightarrow \lang(M) = \AB^*$ or $\lang(M) = \emptyset$)

So we get that: \\
$\lang = \{\langle M \rangle : M \text{ has only 2 states such that } q_0 = q_a \text{ or }q_0 = q_r\}$ \\

Now we can build TM $M''$ that decides $\lang$: \\
$M''$ on input $\langle M \rangle$: \\
1. Check whether $\langle M \rangle$ is a valid encoding of a TM. \\
2. If it is not - reject. \\
3. If $M$ has only 2 states such that $q_0 = q_a$ or $q_0 = q_r$ - accept, otherwise reject. \\

So we get: \\
If $\langle M \rangle \in \lang$ then: \\
$\langle M \rangle$ is a valid encoding of a TM and has only 2 states such that $q_0 = q_a$ or $q_0 = q_r$. \\
$\Rightarrow M''$ accepts. \\

If $\langle M \rangle \notin \lang$ then: \\
$\langle M \rangle$ is not a valid encoding of a TM or $M$ doesn't have only 2 states such that $q_0 = q_a$ or $q_0 = q_r$. \\
$\Rightarrow M''$ rejects. \\

We got that $M''$ accepts every $w \in \lang$ and rejects every $w \notin \lang$. Hence $\lang \in \Rcl$. \\
