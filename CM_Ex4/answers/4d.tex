$\lang = \{\langle M \rangle : \nexists M' \text{ a 2-tape TM } (\text{with } q'_0 \neq q'_a \neq q'_r) \text{ such that } \\
    \lang(M')=\lang(M) \text{ and } M' \text{ has less states than } M\}$ \\

We will show that $\lang \in \Rcl$. \\

from previous exercise there is 2 tape TM with 3 states that emulates 1 tape TM
so for there to not exist a 2 tape TM that emulates 1 tape TM then 1 tape TM must have at most two states
meaning $q_0 = q_a$ or $q_0 = q_r$.
so the 1 tape TM accepts or rejects every word so $\lang(M) = \AB^*$ or $\lang(M) = \emptyset$

so we get that: \\
$\lang = \{\langle M \rangle : M \text{ has only 2 states such that } q_0 = q_a \text{ or }q_0 = q_r\}$ \\

Now we can build TM $M''$ that decides $\lang$: \\
$M''$ on input $\langle M \rangle$: \\
1. Check whether $\langle M \rangle$ is a valid encoding of a TM. \\
2. If it is not - reject. \\
3. If $M$ has only 2 states such that $q_0 = q_a$ $q_0 = q_r$ - accept, otherwise reject. \\

So we get: \\
If $\langle M \rangle \in \lang$ then: \\
$\langle M \rangle$ is a valid encoding of a TM and has only 2 states such that $q_0 = q_a$ $q_0 = q_r$. \\
$\Rightarrow M'$ accepts. \\

If $\langle M \rangle \notin \lang$ then: \\
$\langle M \rangle$ is not a valid encoding of a TM or $M$ doesn't have only 2 states such that $q_0 = q_a$ $q_0 = q_r$. \\
$\Rightarrow M'$ rejects. \\

We got that $M'$ accepts every $w \in \lang$ and rejects every $w \notin \lang$. Hence $\lang \in \Rcl$. \\
