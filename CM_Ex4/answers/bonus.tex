Find the minimal (relative to inclusion) class it belongs to between $\Rcl/\REcl/co\REcl/\overline{\REcl \cup co\REcl}$ for: \\
$\lang = \{\langle M \rangle : \nexists M' \text{ such that } \lang(M')=\lang(M) \text{ and } M' \text{ has less states than } M\}$  \\

show reduction $\overline{EQ} \leq_m \lang$

$EQ \in \overline{\REcl \cup co\REcl}$

maybe like in 4d, can take a 2 tape TM so there has to be only 2 states
